## The Short Version:
A simple weather dashboard working from the US.

## More in-depth user control:
The application allows you to: 
 * view the current time as a header
 * automatically captures your location to give you up to date weather upon first visit
 * will automatically show you your last saved search there after
 * shows the user the current weather and the expected forecast for the next five days
 * utilies the openweathermap API for its information
